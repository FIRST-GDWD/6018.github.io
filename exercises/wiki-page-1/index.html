            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also 
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
            <sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,
            <sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) 
            is a feature observed in 
            some tree species, in which the crowns 
            of fully stocked trees do not touch 
            each other, instead forming a canopy 
            with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> 
            This is 
            most prevalent among trees of the same 
            species, but also occurs between trees 
            of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> 
            There 
            exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and 
            research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

            The exact physiological basis of crown 
            shyness is uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> 
            It has been 
            discussed in scientific literature 
            since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The 
            variety of 
            hypotheses and experimental results 
            might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, 
            an example of convergent evolution.
